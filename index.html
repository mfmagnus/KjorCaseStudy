                        <p>The petrol industry is homogenous. There are limited of no differentiation in the category. Preference in the category is randomized and heavily dependent on location and where you are when you feel the need to refuel your car. The product are basically the same, there is limited variation in services between stations and the category if overladed with  boring tactical offers selling sausages and pastries. This need to be challenged. </p>

                        <p>Smartphones and tables these days have access to a GPS which becomes the basis for achieving a two key functions; Allowing the car in the game to reflect the speed of the vehicle in which the player actually sits, and knowing exactly where the player is relative to actual Statoil stations.</p>
                        <div class="twoFourths left first">
	                        <h2>Speed</h2>
	                        <p>The first technical challenge lies in using the GPS data in creating an immersive and responsive gameplay that truly gives the passenger the feel of being in control of the car. With intelligent code that balances accuracy with battery usage, we were able to create a realistic gameplay feeling that doesn't end too soon.
	                        </p>
							<h2>Position</h2>
							<p>The GPS also allows us to pinpoint quite exactly where the player is at all times. By also having the coordinates to all Statoil stations across the country, concepts such as geo-fencing allows accurate detection of the player being within medium or close range of any given station. Combined with knowing the speed, we have a way to also detect players actually stopping at a Statoil station.

				    <div class="twoFifths right first">
				        <h2>Spawners &amp; The Open Road</h2>
				        <p>The idea and concept of spawners is simple; It can be viewed as logic that allows for spawning (or creating) and destroying (or removing) game objects such as coins, road tiles, terrain and obstacles in an intelligent manner. One challenge was to giving the player a potentially endless journey, another to create a balanced and entertaining game.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
				        <h2>Curves &amp; Collisions</h2>
				        <p>Enter curves and collision detection! By using smart and well tuned curves, we can control such concepts like difficulties by balancing the spawning of coins vs. obstacles. Collisions are detected between the player and game objects allowing for collecting rewards and avoiding crashing into obstacles. The road shoulder can be used as a safe haven from obstacles, but it too detects collisions with the player and will slowly drain coins.</p>
