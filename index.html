                    <p>Statoil Fuel and Retail needed to increase traffic to the stores, and see a potential for huge growth if they are able to create a strong customer relationship program that would increase preference for Statoil above competing gas stations.</p>

                        <h2>The Insight</h2>
                        <p>The petrol industry is homogenous, and there are limited to no differentiation in the category. The driver's preference as well as simple coincidence are the main deciding factors of where customers stop to refuel their car. The products offered are basically the same, there is limited variation in services offered, and the category if overloaded with boring tactical offers - selling sausages and pastries. This needs to be challenged.</p>
						<h2>The Challenge</h2>
						<p>How can one stand out in the crowd and attract attention in a less traditional, and more effective way? Could we shift the discussion to passengers? Could the car trip be made more fun? Today's entertainment booklets for kids are perceived as outdated, costly in production and nobody picks them up.</p>

                    <p>The main concept behind the game is having passengers play a driving game simulating real-life and real-time events and conditions around them. By driving a virtual car and collecting coins, avoiding danger, and keeping the fuel tank full, the player scores points with the potential to exchange virtual achievements for free real products at Statoil gas stations.</p>

                        <p>Players have to collect both silver and gold coins along the road whilst avoiding potholes and other obstacles such as the road margins. Hitting obstacles, and seeking the safety of the road shoulder for too long, results in silver coin loss. Players also have to make sure they have enough fuel in the tank to continue playing.</p>
                        
                        <p>If the player runs out of fuel the game is over, but the tank can be refilled by spending silver coins.</p>

						 <h2>Minigames</h2>
						 <p>In order to refill fuel, players have to play a mini-game where the challenge is to get the pump nozzle into the gas tank entrance by tilting their phone. There is a time limit for completion of this task after which a set amount of silver coins will removed from the players account.</p>
						 <p>If the player does not have this amount before attempting to refuel they are prompted to continue playing.</p>

                    <p>How do we use exciting new technology to give an immersive and believable feeling of being a "real" backseat driver, while creating addictive and rewarding gameplay.</p>

                        <h1>Speed &amp; Position</h1>
                        <p>Smartphones and tables these days have access to a GPS which becomes the basis for achieving a two key functions; Allowing the car in the game to reflect the speed of the vehicle in which the player actually sits, and knowing exactly where the player is relative to actual Statoil stations.</p>
                        <div class="twoFourths left first">
	                        <h2>Speed</h2>
	                        <p>The first technical challenge lies in using the GPS data in creating an immersive and responsive gameplay that truly gives the passenger the feel of being in control of the car. With intelligent code that balances accuracy with battery usage, we were able to create a realistic gameplay feeling that doesn't end too soon.
	                        </p>
							<h2>Position</h2>
							<p>The GPS also allows us to pinpoint quite exactly where the player is at all times. By also having the coordinates to all Statoil stations across the country, concepts such as geo-fencing allows accurate detection of the player being within medium or close range of any given station. Combined with knowing the speed, we have a way to also detect players actually stopping at a Statoil station.

                        <p>With accelerometers and gyroscopes now standard in phones and tables, these become the basis for the player's interaction in the game; Steering becomes a natural tilting from side to side much like using a steering wheel, and mini games to refill the tank provides a more all-axis challenge to keep the nozzle from spilling.</p>

							    <h2>Spawners &amp; The Open Road</h2>
							    <p>The idea and concept of spawners is simple; It can be viewed as logic that allows for spawning (or creating) and destroying (or removing) game objects such as coins, road tiles, terrain and obstacles in an intelligent manner. One challenge was to giving the player a potentially endless journey, another to create a balanced and entertaining game.</p>

							    <h2>Curves &amp; Collisions</h2>
							    <p>Enter curves and collision detection! By using smart and well tuned curves, we can control such concepts like difficulties by balancing the spawning of coins vs. obstacles. Collisions are detected between the player and game objects allowing for collecting rewards and avoiding crashing into obstacles. The road shoulder can be used as a safe haven from obstacles, but it too detects collisions with the player and will slowly drain coins.</p>

The exact numbers remain confidential, but it is safe to say that the app has achieved it's goal of increasing traffic into Statoil stations.</p>
